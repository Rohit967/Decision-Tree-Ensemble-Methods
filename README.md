# Decision-Tree-Ensemble-Methods
In this we are going to implement decision tree and Ensemble methods. To predict the test data
set and print out both the training accuracy results and testing accuracy results. It breaks down a Data-
set into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally
developed. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes, training and testing accuracy
score. Solving with both a logistic regression problem and classification problem using Decision Tree,
Ensemble, Voting, Bagging and Random Forest.
